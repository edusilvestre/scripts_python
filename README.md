Scripts to improve my Python skills

The first idea is put secondary scripts in a primary script, 
wheres the primary calls the secondary scripts, saves the user who's running the program into another file .csv
and makes an access log.
Then, make the primary uses the .csv file as a login checker, 
when the primary script can create new users or verify if the user is already registered.

Enjoy!
